## 💡 How It Works

### Question Format
```json
{
  "question": "Which services provide serverless compute? (Select 2)",
  "options": [
    "AWS Lambda",
    "Amazon EC2",
    "AWS Fargate",
    "Amazon RDS"
  ],
  "answer": ["AWS Lambda", "AWS Fargate"],
  "correctCount": 2,
  "explanation": "Both Lambda and Fargate provide serverless compute..."
}
```

### Scoring Logic
- **Partial credit is NOT given**
- Must select ALL correct answers to get the point
- Selecting too many or too few = incorrect
- This matches real exam scoring!

---

## 📈 Impact on User Scores

### What to Expect
- **Scores may initially be lower** - multi-select questions are harder!
- **This is normal and expected** - real exams are challenging
- **Practice makes perfect** - users will improve with repetition
- **Better preparation** - harder practice = better real exam performance

### Passing Threshold
- Still 70% to pass (matching real exams)
- 7 out of 10 questions correct
- Multi-select questions count the same as single-select
