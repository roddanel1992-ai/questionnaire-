    # SageMaker Questions (80 professional questions)
    sagemaker_questions = [
        {
            "question": "A data science team needs to train a computer vision model using 50GB of image data stored in Amazon S3. The training job is expected to take 12 hours. To reduce costs, the team wants to use Spot instances but is concerned about potential interruptions. Which SageMaker feature should they enable to handle Spot instance interruptions gracefully?",
            "options": [
                "SageMaker Managed Spot Training with automatic checkpoint saving to S3",
                "Manual EC2 Spot instances without SageMaker",
                "On-Demand instances only",
                "Reserved instances for training",
                "Local training on team laptops"
            ],
            "answer": "SageMaker Managed Spot Training with automatic checkpoint saving to S3",
            "correctCount": 1,
            "explanation": "SageMaker Managed Spot Training automatically handles Spot interruptions by saving checkpoints to S3. If interrupted, training resumes from the last checkpoint, minimizing wasted computation while achieving up to 90% cost savings."
        },
        {
            "question": "A machine learning engineer is deploying a model that needs to serve predictions with sub-50ms latency. The traffic pattern shows 10,000 requests per hour during business hours and nearly zero traffic at night. Which SageMaker deployment approach optimizes both cost and performance?",
            "options": [
                "Real-Time Inference endpoint with target-tracking auto-scaling based on InvocationsPerInstance",
                "Batch Transform running 24/7",
                "Asynchronous Inference for all requests",
                "Serverless Inference endpoint",
                "EC2 instances with manual scaling"
            ],
            "answer": "Real-Time Inference endpoint with target-tracking auto-scaling based on InvocationsPerInstance",
            "correctCount": 1,
            "explanation": "Real-Time Inference provides the low latency required (sub-50ms). Auto-scaling based on InvocationsPerInstance automatically adds instances during high traffic and removes them during low traffic, optimizing costs while maintaining performance."
        },
        {
            "question": "A company is building an ML pipeline where data scientists frequently experiment with different algorithms. Models need to be versioned, tracked, and approved before production deployment. Which SageMaker features support this MLOps workflow? (Select 2)",
            "options": [
                "SageMaker Model Registry for versioning and approval workflows",
                "SageMaker Experiments for tracking training runs and parameters",
                "SageMaker Ground Truth for data labeling only",
                "Manual Excel spreadsheet tracking",
                "Local Git repository for models"

    # Rekognition Questions (60 professional questions)
    rekognition_questions = [
        {
            "question": "A retail chain wants to analyze customer traffic patterns in their stores using existing security camera footage. They need to count unique customers entering/exiting, detect customer demographics (age range, gender), and measure dwell time in different store sections. All analysis must comply with privacy regulations. Which Amazon Rekognition features meet these requirements? (Select 2)",
            "options": [
                "Face detection with demographic attributes (age range, gender)",
                "Person tracking to follow individuals through the store",
                "Face comparison to identify specific individuals",
                "Custom Labels for detecting store products",
                "Celebrity recognition in retail stores"
            ],
            "answer": ["Face detection with demographic attributes (age range, gender)", "Person tracking to follow individuals through the store"],
            "correctCount": 2,
            "explanation": "Face detection with demographic attributes provides anonymous age range and gender estimates without identifying individuals (privacy-compliant). Person tracking follows individuals through video frames to measure movement and dwell time without facial recognition."
        },
        {
            "question": "An insurance company processes 50,000 claim photos daily. They need to detect specific types of vehicle damage (windshield cracks, body dents, bumper damage, tire issues) that standard object detection doesn't recognize. The accuracy requirement is 92%+ for each damage category. What is the most efficient solution?",
            "options": [
                "Train Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels with 500+ labeled examples per damage category",
                "Use standard Rekognition object detection without customization",
                "Build custom CNN from scratch using TensorFlow",
                "Manual inspection of all photos",
                "Use third-party computer vision API"
            ],
            "answer": "Train Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels with 500+ labeled examples per damage category",
            "correctCount": 1,
            "explanation": "Rekognition Custom Labels allows you to train models for specific use cases without deep ML expertise. With 500+ labeled examples per category, you can achieve 92%+ accuracy for custom damage detection that standard models don't recognize."

            "options": [
                "Sentiment analysis to measure positive, negative, neutral, and mixed sentiment",
